# Flash_Project1
College project using Adobe Animate.

Adobe Flash is depreciated but my university still has an introductory course for it. This project allowed my to show my artistic side along with learning action script. When loading blast_off.swf in IP4.swf player the start and stop buttons will not work because its out of scope(I will change this in the future). To properly use the start and stop buttons within blast_off.swf please open the file as a standalone swf.
